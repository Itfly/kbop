{"name":"Key Based Object Pool","tagline":"Thread safe, fast, lightweight Key Based Object Pool","body":"# Key Based Object Pool 1.0.0\r\n====\r\n\r\n*Key Based Object Pooling (Thread Safe, Simple and Light) aka KBOP\r\n\r\nKBOP is a lightweight Keyed Object Pool which supports Single Key to Single Object Pooling or Single Key to Multiple Object Pooling.  KBOP provides factory lifecycles, metrics, borrowing, releasing and object invalidation.\r\n\r\n### Setup\r\n\r\nMaven Dependency Setup\r\n\r\n```xml\r\n<dependency>\r\n\t<groupId>org.pacesys</groupId>\r\n\t<artifactId>kbop</artifactId>\r\n\t<version>1.0.0</version>\r\n</dependency>\r\n```\r\n\r\n## Usage\r\n\r\nCreating : Single Key to Single Object Based Pool\r\n```java\r\nIKeyedObjectPool.Single<String,MyObject>> pool = Pools.createPool(factory));\r\n````\r\n\r\nCreating : Single Key to Multiple Object Based Pool\r\n```java\r\nIKeyedObjectPool.Multi<MyKey, MyObject> = Pools.createMultiPool(factory, maxItemsPerKey)\r\n````\r\n\r\nBorrowing Objects from the Pool - Block until available\r\n```java\r\n// borrow an object and block until available\r\nIPooledObject<MyObject> obj = pool.borrow(key);\r\n````\r\n\r\nBorrowing Objects from the Pool - Block until max time has elapsed\r\n```java\r\nIPooledObject<MyObject> obj = pool.borrow(key, 1, TimeUnit.SECONDS);\r\n````\r\n\r\nReleasing Objects back to the Pool\r\n```java\r\nIPooledObject<MyObject> obj = pool.borrow(key);\r\n\r\n// Release via borrowed Object\r\nobj.release();\r\n\r\n// Release via Pool\r\npool.release(obj);\r\n````\r\n\r\nInvalidating a borrowed object - The pool will release the object and destroy it.  The next time\r\nan object is requested for the same key the pool will re-create a new instance\r\n```java\r\nIPooledObject<MyObject> obj = pool.borrow(key);\r\npool.invalidate(obj);\r\n````\r\n\r\nShutting down a Pool\r\n```java\r\npool.shutdown();\r\n````\r\n\r\nImplementing a Factory to Create Objects when needed to populate a Pool\r\n```java\r\nIPoolObjectFactory<String, MyObject> factory = new IPoolObjectFactory<String, MyObject>() \r\n{\r\n  /**\r\n   * Creates the defined Object V based on the current Pool Key.\r\n   *\r\n   * @param key the key being requested\r\n   * @return the Object to be inserted into the Pool\r\n   */\r\n  public String create(PoolKey<String> key) {\r\n     // Create the Object based on the Key\r\n     return new MyObject();\r\n  }\r\n\r\n  /**\r\n   * Reinitialize an instance to be returned to the borrower\r\n   *\r\n   * @param object the object being borrowed\r\n   */\r\n  @Override\r\n  public void activate(MyObject object) {\r\n    // called right\r\n  }\r\n\r\n  /**\r\n   * Uninitialize an instance which has been released back to the pool\r\n   *\r\n   * @param object the object to which has just beel released\r\n   */\r\n  @Override\r\n  public void passivate(String object) {\r\n  }\r\n\r\n  /**\r\n   * Destroy/Release an instance no longer needed by the pool\r\n   *\r\n   * @param object the object to destroy\r\n   */\r\n  @Override\r\n  public void destroy(String object) {\r\n  }\r\n};\r\n````\r\n\r\n# License:\r\n\r\nKBOP is hereby released under the MIT License.\r\n\r\nCopyright (c) 2013 Jeremy Unruh\r\n\r\nPermission is hereby granted, free of charge, to any person obtaining a copy of this software and associated documentation files (the \"Software\"), to deal in the Software without restriction, including without limitation the rights to use, copy, modify, merge, publish, distribute, sublicense, and/or sell copies of the Software, and to permit persons to whom the Software is furnished to do so, subject to the following conditions:\r\n\r\nThe above copyright notice and this permission notice shall be included in all copies or substantial portions of the Software.\r\n\r\nTHE SOFTWARE IS PROVIDED \"AS IS\", WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO THE WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE AND NONINFRINGEMENT.
